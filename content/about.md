Hey fam 🍍,

{{< image src="/img/gmo_crop.jpg" alt="Hello Friend" position="left" style="border-radius: 8px; length: 250px; width: 250px;" >}}

I'm a student in CS and I love drinking a cold one on the weekend with the homies.

I like to program in C++, Python.


Seriously though, look at my C++ code below.

```c++
#include  <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello fam" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Thanks again, for coming to my site!
